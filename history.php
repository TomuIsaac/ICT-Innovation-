The above problem has  been prevalent for a number of years and for more than one reason affected  people  due  lining up   for registration forms ,accordingly   clients are disappointed about   what is going on over  company  registration .A lot of complaints have been raised  due  a  lot of time wastage  hence  researchers  had to come up with a  solution to design an  on line company  registration system to ease work. <br>
        However company  registration is done manually on paper based which is not secure, delay in  company registration and processing of data takes a lot of time. Therefore  people have to wait for long time and there high costs incurred due to movement  and this calls for an online company registration system for easy effectiveness  and efficiency in terms of service delivery.</p></td>
